    <h2>Fun Facts About Cheetahs</h2>
    <section class="overview">
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside; padding-left: 1em;">
        <li><strong>Speed Demons:</strong> Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to <strong>70 mph (112 km/h)</strong> in short bursts.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero to Hero:</strong> They can go from 0 to 60 mph in just <strong>under 3 seconds</strong>—faster than most sports cars.</li>
        <li><strong>Silent Hunters:</strong> Cheetahs do not roar like lions or tigers—they chirp, hiss, growl, and purr!</li>
        <li><strong>Built for Speed:</strong> Their claws are non-retractable, acting like cleats for extra traction while running.</li>
        <li><strong>Tail Rudder:</strong> A cheetah’s tail acts like a rudder, helping them balance and steer while chasing prey at high speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Black “Tear Marks”:</strong> The dark lines under their eyes reduce glare from the sun—like natural sunglasses.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast but Fragile:</strong> Despite their speed, cheetahs aren’t strong fighters—they often lose their food to lions or hyenas.</li>
        <li><strong>Super Sight:</strong> Cheetahs hunt by sight, not smell. They spot prey from over 3 miles away!</li>
        <li><strong>Solo Sprinters:</strong> Unlike lions, cheetahs are solitary or live in small family groups called “coalitions.”</li>
        <li><strong>Low Numbers:</strong> There are fewer than <strong>7,000 wild cheetahs</strong> left in the world today.</li>
        <li><strong>Fastest Acceleration:</strong> Cheetahs can reach full speed in just a few strides—about <strong>three seconds</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>High Heart Rate:</strong> Their heart beats over <strong>250 times per minute</strong> during a sprint!</li>
