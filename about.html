      <h3>ðŸ“¢ Animal Communication</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs are highly vocal animals and use various sounds to communicate with each other.</p>
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside;">
        <li><strong>Chirping:</strong> A high-pitched call used by mothers to communicate with cubs or for siblings to locate each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Purring:</strong> Cheetahs purr when resting, often as a sign of contentmentâ€”much like house cats.</li>
        <li><strong>Growling and Hissing:</strong> These are warning sounds, often used when threatened or competing for food.</li>
        <li><strong>Yawns and Ear Movements:</strong> These non-vocal signals help express mood or intent.</li>
        <li><strong>To Other Species:</strong> Cheetahs do not intentionally communicate with other species, but growls, hisses, and body language may act as defensive signals against predators or competitors.</li>
      </ul>
