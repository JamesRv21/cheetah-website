    <h2>Cheetahs in Popular Culture</h2>

    <section class="overview">
      <h3>🎬 Movies</h3>
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside;">
        <li><strong>Tarzan (1999)</strong> – Features a stylized cheetah named Sabor. However, Sabor is inaccurately portrayed as aggressive and villainous, despite cheetahs typically avoiding conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Madagascar (2005)</strong> – Though more focused on lions and zebras, the DreamWorks franchise introduced a fast feline in minor roles, increasing visibility of cheetahs among children.</li>
        <li><strong>The Lion Guard (Disney Junior)</strong> – The character Fuli, a female cheetah, is a prominent member of the Lion Guard, accurately reflecting a cheetah’s speed and independence.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="overview">
      <h3>📚 Books</h3>
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside;">
        <li><strong>“Chester the Cheetah” (Various Children’s Books)</strong> – Often featured in snack-brand spin-offs, Chester represents speed, coolness, and cleverness, although not rooted in realism.</li>
        <li><strong>“Cheetahs” by Luke Hunter (Wildlife Conservation Series)</strong> – A scientifically accurate and visually rich guide exploring cheetah biology and ecology for older readers.</li>
        <li><strong>“Cheetah Girls” (Deborah Gregory)</strong> – While not about actual cheetahs, this series uses cheetahs as symbols of female power, uniqueness, and speed in the context of pop music and girlhood identity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="overview">
      <h3>📺 Documentaries</h3>

    <section class="overview">
      <h3>⚠️ Misrepresentations & Their Impact</h3>
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside;">
        <li><strong>“Villainous Predators”</strong> – Cheetahs are sometimes incorrectly shown as aggressive killers (e.g., <em>Tarzan</em>'s Sabor). In reality, they are skittish and rarely fight other animals.</li>
        <li><strong>“Just Fast” Stereotype</strong> – While speed is a standout trait, many pop culture pieces ignore their vulnerability, maternal care, and unique evolutionary adaptations.</li>
        <li><strong>“Exotic Pet” Glamorization</strong> – Music videos and social posts featuring pet cheetahs have fueled demand for illegal wildlife trade, harming conservation efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Impact:</strong> These portrayals lead to poor public understanding, reduced sympathy for conservation, and unrealistic expectations around wild animal behavior.</li>
      </ul>
