    <h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
    <section class="overview">
      <h3>Hunting and Feeding</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs hunt during the day, usually early morning or late afternoon. They use sight to locate prey like gazelles, impalas, and hares. After a burst of high-speed chase, they trip their prey with a swipe of the paw and suffocate it with a bite to the throat.</p>

      <h3>Defense and Predator Avoidance</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs avoid confrontation. They rely on speed to escape predators rather than fight. Mothers hide cubs in dense grass and move them frequently to reduce risk of discovery by lions or hyenas.</p>

      <h3>Sleeping and Resting</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs rest for the majority of the day—typically up to 18 hours. After intense activity, such as a sprint or feeding, they need long recovery periods.</p>

      <h3>Other Behaviors</h3>
      <p>Male cheetahs often form small groups called "coalitions," usually made up of siblings. Females are mostly solitary, except when raising cubs.</p>
