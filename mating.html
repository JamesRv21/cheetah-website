    <h2>Mating and Reproduction Information</h2>
    <section class="overview">
      <p>Cheetahs typically mate throughout the year, with no fixed breeding season. Males do not participate in raising young, and females raise cubs on their own.</p>
      <ul style="list-style: disc inside;">
        <li><strong>Gestational Period:</strong> About 90–95 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Litter Size:</strong> 3 to 5 cubs (can range from 1 to 8).</li>
        <li><strong>Parental Care Duration:</strong> Cubs stay with their mother for approximately 18 months, learning hunting and survival skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Cubs are born with a silvery mane along their back to help camouflage them in the grass—mimicking the honey badger!</li>
