    <h2>Animal Anatomy and Biology</h2>
    <section class="overview">
      <h3>Size Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Male Height:</strong> 84–94 cm at the shoulder</li>
        <li><strong>Female Height:</strong> Slightly smaller, ~70–80 cm at the shoulder</li>
        <li><strong>Male Weight:</strong> 45–65 kg</li>
        <li><strong>Female Weight:</strong> 35–45 kg</li>
        <li><strong>Body Length:</strong> 110–150 cm (excluding tail)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unique Physical Features</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs have a slim build, long legs, small collar bones, and flexible spines that allow them to stretch their bodies while sprinting. Their non-retractable claws provide traction, and black "tear marks" beneath their eyes help reduce sun glare.</p>

      <h3>Respiratory System</h3>
      <p>Cheetahs breathe through lungs like all mammals. During a sprint, their breathing rate can increase dramatically to over 150 breaths per minute to meet oxygen demands.</p>

      <h3>Lifespan</h3>
      <p>In the wild, cheetahs live an average of 10–12 years. In captivity, with veterinary care, they can live up to 17 years.</p>
