# 🐆 Scrum Zoo – Cheetah Website

Welcome to **Scrum Zoo**, a themed educational website all about cheetahs! This site was developed as part of an **Applying Professional Scrum** workshop to demonstrate team collaboration, iterative development, and delivery of working software through structured sprint cycles.

## 👥 Team Members

This project was created by:

- **James Harvey**
- **Katelyn Mchanon**
- **Linus Carey**

Under the instruction of **Simon Reindl**, a certified Professional Scrum Trainer from [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/).

## 📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a small, functional, and engaging website using Scrum practices. The website consists of multiple interactive and informative pages focused on cheetahs, the fastest land animal on Earth. It serves both as an educational tool and a demonstration of Agile methodologies in action.


## 🧩 Scrum in Practice

This website was developed over the course of a **2-day intensive workshop**, structured into **four Scrum sprints**. Each sprint included the following key Scrum events:

- **Sprint Planning** – Determining the goal and scope of the sprint  
- **Sprint Review** – Demonstrating and discussing completed work  
- **Sprint Retrospective** – Reflecting on improvements for the next sprint

Throughout the process, we actively practiced Agile principles such as transparency, inspection, and adaptation, while fulfilling our Scrum roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.

## 🏆 Certification

At the conclusion of the workshop, **James Harvey successfully passed the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I)** certification exam, demonstrating a strong understanding of the Scrum framework and its application in real-world scenarios.
