      <h2>About the Cheetah</h2>
        </a>
      <p>
        The cheetah (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>) is renowned for its slender build, long legs, and distinctive spotted coat.
        As the fastest land animal, it can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0–97 km/h) in just a few strides, reaching top speeds of up to 70 mph (112 km/h).
        Unlike other big cats, cheetahs cannot roar; instead, they communicate through chirps, growls, and purrs when content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Native to sub-Saharan Africa, cheetahs prefer wide-open spaces such as savannahs and grasslands. They primarily hunt during the day, relying on their keen eyesight
        to spot prey—such as gazelles and impalas—from a distance. However, their populations are under threat from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and illegal trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Scrum Zoo, we’re committed to educating visitors about cheetah ecology, supporting ongoing conservation efforts, and ensuring a safe environment for our resident cheetah family.
        Join us in celebrating and protecting these extraordinary creatures!
